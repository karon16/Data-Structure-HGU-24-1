Hi, 

There are two problems (a and b). Please submit your source files (hw1a.c and hw1b.c).

#1. Implement a code to print out the smallest number of the file.
Test your code with file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt 

The execution should look like the followings: 

Input filename:  file1.txt
The smallest number is 3

Input filename:  file2.txt
The smallest number is 11

Input filename:  file3.txt
The smallest number is 9

 

The sample files (file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt) are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e7qvfmumHl5ecft2wf6E78-NYTygOWfX?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.) 

 

#2. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the given file: 

Ex: example1.txt (This file is also available at the link above)

Funding in A.I. start-ups has increased more than fourfold to
$681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to
the market research firm CB Insights.

The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1.2
billion (CAD1.5B) this year, up 76 percent from last year.

(from NYT)


For the example above, your program is supposed to print out

"The sum is 4930.7".

(Because 681 + 2015 + 145 + 2011 + 1.2 + 1.5 + 76 = 4930.7)

- You have to get a file name as an input.

* You can assume that there are no negative numbers.

* You can use ‘stof’ or 'atof' to convert string to float.
